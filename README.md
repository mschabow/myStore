# Mystore

This project utilizes data from fakestoreapi.com to populate products in a store. The user can view the product details, add items to a cart, adjust quantities and remove items from the cart, and checkout. After checkout, the cart is cleared and the user receives a confirmation that the order has been placed.

## Running the App
Run `ng install` to install the required modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
